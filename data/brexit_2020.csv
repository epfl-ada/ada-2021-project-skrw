Euroscepticism was never a selfish ideology. It was never just about returning self-government to Britain. No genuine Eurosceptic ever claimed that it was fine for the Netherlands or Spain to have to swap democracy for technocracy, but unacceptable for the UK. If it was bad for us, it was also bad for them. Early Eurosceptic groups maintained close ties with fellow travellers from Europe: Vaclav Klaus, the Thatcherite former Czech president, was the guest at a Brexit Party rally last year. Euroscepticism is the application to the EU of a universalist theory based on a broad set of principles: national self-government is better, over time, for peace, prosperity and liberty than belonging to technocratic superstructures; genuine democracy can only exist within a demos, such as as a nation; competition and co-operation between smaller, nimble, independent, liberal democracies is a better, more resilient way of organising the world than handling over power to gigantic, unresponsive political monopolies run by bureaucrat-kings.",Allister Heath,['Q19282266'],"[['Allister Heath', '0.8972'], ['None', '0.1028']]"

2020-01-28,"The irresponsible UK Tory Government has created mayhem for this year's budget-setting process in North Lanarkshire. The normal set timetable is: the UK budget in early November, including the announcement of the Scottish Government's block grant of some Â£ 30 billion; and then the draft Scottish Government budget in early December, which announced the draft revenue grant for each local council. This gave the council 10 weeks to discuss the budget, prior to setting the budget and council tax in late February. This time, the UK budget, scheduled for November 6, was recklessly scrapped by the Tory Government in protest over MPs opposing Boris Johnson's undemocratic attempt to push through his Brexit deal in a matter of days. Now the UK budget is to be on March 11; London did not bother to inform the Scottish Finance Minister, Derek MacKay -- he learned the date from the news. The Scottish Government must now set a budget in February -- without knowing its key block grant from Westminster until the following month. This creates uncertainty about the council's final revenue grant -- a massive 80 per cent of council income (the council tax provides just 18 per cent of council income). Budgeting is a challenge. Under years of Tory austerity, the Scottish block grant has been cut by Westminster by Â£ 1.7 billion -- in real terms -- over the past decade. This affects the revenue grant to North Lanarkshire Council. Yet, despite this, every local authority in Scotland received a cash increase last year. This is because we have to factor in other, ring-fenced, cash injections given by the Scottish Government -- Â£ 16 million to the council for the pupil equity fund and the Scottish attainment challenge; and Â£ 34 million for nine new nursery buildings in the council for 1140 hours nursery expansion. Even more widely, the Scottish Government will contribute near - Â£ 100 million to the North Lanarkshire infrastructure over the 10-year Glasgow and Clyde Valley City Deal. Indeed, the council will invest in excess of Â£ 2 billion in improved infrastructure, facilities and services over the next 10 years. It is good to see North Lanarkshire and four other partner councils will now divert 190,000 tonnes of black bag waste from landfill each year and convert it into energy. The waste will be treated at Viridor's facility in Bargeddie and turned into fuel for burning at a plant in Dunbar and enough to produce energy for 70,000 homes.

Â In the great scheme of things, it's not a big slice of national income. The EU budget is supplemented with customs revenue and money from antitrust fines - and the EU has levied billions worth of those in recent years. So, individually, countries are paying less than 1% of their annual earnings. The commission says budget spending should be seen as a contribution fee to one of the world's biggest wealth-generating organizations. It says the advantages that countries get back as members of the largest trading bloc on the planet are worth about 6% on their gross national income. Still, at over a trillion euros, it's not exactly pocket change. Ahead of the negotiations, the 27 member nations are roughly divided into two main camps. The so-called' Â Frugal Four' Â of Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden versus the' Â Friends of Cohesion,' Â a group of mainly central and eastern European nations who like to see their contributions return home in the form of' Â cohesion funds' Â that help develop Europe's poorer regions. Ahead of the summit, the frugal four, who would like the budget to drop as low as 1%, rejected Michel's offer in a Financial Times newspaper op-ed, saying that in light of Brexit' Â we simply have to cut our coat according to our cloth.'

I felt nervous because I'd no idea how people would react and as someone in a public position, I knew there'd be a public reaction of some sort. Within seconds of me tweeting out, a flood of amazing responses came back. All, and I mean literally all, positive.

After the huge emotion of the moment and amazing response, life quickly got back to normal, but a much better version of normal than before. Gone was the worry about what people might think -- I knew they were supportive, and instead I was able to be someone who could help others in the LGBT community to take the same step and be open about who they were.

We accomplished these results despite the continued negative impact in the global economy driven by US/China trade negotiations, Brexit uncertainty, global industrial production declines and significant commercial aerospace production delays at a key customer. We continue to gain traction on the key pillars of Vision 2025, under which we target: $8 billion in revenues, 20% operating margin, and 15% ROIC, all driving to $15 of earnings per share. As we embark on year three of Vision 2025, we will build on the achievements of our first two years and continue to drive towards our objectives of: achieving 5% organic growth with leverage, utilizing the Carlisle Operating System (COS) to deliver efficiencies and annual cost savings of 1-2% of revenues, deploying $3 billion to build scale with synergistic acquisitions, continuing to invest in exceptional talent and allocating over $3 billion into capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends. Full year 2019 highlights include: Delivered 2.8% organic revenue growth despite significant global headwinds; leveraged this growth to expand operating margins 220 basis points Drove organic revenue growth of 5.0% since launching Vision 2025, in line with our long-term target Maintained strong price discipline, leading to positive price realization across all businesses Achieved gross savings and benefits from COS within our targeted range of 1-2% of revenues Deployed over $600 million of capital into 8 strategic and synergistic acquisitions Leveraged our strong cash flow and balance sheet by deploying over $485 million into share repurchases and dividends paid; 3-year total of $1.4 billion In addition to our strong financial performance, we are pleased about the continued momentum our team has generated around Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) issues. In 2019 we established an ESG steering committee, developed an ESG reporting process, elevated the position of Director of Sustainability to report directly to the CEO and established a plan to publish our first ESG report in 2020. Additionally, we made progress in diversifying our Board of Directors and have made commitments to ensuring a $15 per hour minimum wage in our U.S. operations, gender pay equity, and a gender-balanced management team. We are pleased with our significant accomplishments and strong performance in a challenging 2019.

2020-03-25,"In an election campaign, political parties choose one clear message to repeat ad nauseam. Strong and stable, For the many, not the few, Leave means leave and Get Brexit done, for example. They do this because it sticks. With the COVID-19 crisis, the picture is changing daily and the government's message is too. So people are struggling to keep on top of it. The government started using the Catch it. Bin it. Kill it. slogan to encourage hygiene and prevent the spread of the virus. I recently heard my six-year-old repeat this before washing his hands, so it's obviously working. They are now saying: Stay at Home. Protect the NHS. Save lives. As with the election campaign messages, these slogans follow the rule of three -- three being the smallest number a pattern can be formed from. In the past we've had: Stop, Look and Listen, and: See it. Say it. Sorted. This always reminds me of the old Blackpool Pleasure Beach strap line See It. Feel It. Love It. These simple, unambiguous instructions tell people what to do and what's expected of them. Now, people are being told we need to `flatten the curve' or worse `squash the sombrero' without a clear understanding of exactly how this can be done. It seems that people respond far more readily to direct instructions than advice on what they could do if they decide to deprioritise their own needs for the greater good. The term `lockdown' has been accepted much more willingly (and even enthusiastically) by the media and the general public than the more abstract, less assertive `social distancing' . What we're seeing is a combination of: science and policy that is changing on a daily basis; politicians trying to convey messages that sound authoritative yet not authoritarian, delivered with a whiff of Churchillian patriotism; and a general public who in part are in denial about the seriousness of the situation.
