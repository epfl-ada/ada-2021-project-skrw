Hardy has designed footwear and jewellery collections for Hermès since 2001, and the company said its acquisition highlights its ambition to contribute to Pierre Hardy's growth plans and solidify its close working relationship with the designer. The move adds to Hermès' interest in the luxury footwear market -- the company also owns traditional British shoemaker John Lobb -- and marks a new period of growth for Pierre Hardy as it pushes forward with its expansion plans at time when demand for shoes is outpacing bags and apparel. Advertisement Hermès has a history of strategically supporting the designers it works with. In 2003, when Jean Paul Gaultier was appointed the creative director for its womenswear, the company acquired a 30 percent stake in his label. Hermès sold the stake to Puig in 2011, after it ended its collaboration with Gaultier. `I'm very pleased, and very proud, of our alliance with Hermès, a house which champions the exceptional.

2016-07-20,"Prior to the referendum at least, the UK labour market appears to have gained strength. The average 3M change in employment between March and May showed that 176k jobs were added, substantially above last month's figure of 55k (which was around of quarter of what it was around the turn of the year). In fact, the single month figure, which considers the change in employment in the three months to May, showed that the economy added the greatest number of jobs since February 2015. Perhaps this is an indication that the uncertainty heading into the referendum didn't affect hiring to the extent that had previously been assumed, although it is possible that this is simply reflected more heavily in June's data released next month. In any case, the main point is that this data is pre-Brexit and thus assumes little relevance for the Bank of England when they meet to decide on the amount of stimulus to add at the start of August. The publication lag means that we won't receive the first post-Brexit reading until September, although as labour market data tends to lag other parts of the economy, it may be a few months after that before any weakness materially appears in the data. However, survey evidence suggests that unemployment will increase over coming years, with the latest Deloitte CFO survey indicating that 66% of firms expect hiring to be lower over the next three years (we are likely to get further evidence of this from Friday's PMIs).",James Smith,"['Q1027519', 'Q10464386', 'Q16534411', 'Q16885746', 'Q20738160', 'Q2389622', 'Q37615128', 'Q3808437', 'Q39395048', 'Q39502042', 'Q43911922', 'Q52440', 'Q54557216', 'Q56724422', 'Q57903671', 'Q5925871', 'Q6143308', 'Q6143312', 'Q6143324', 'Q6143330', 'Q6143331', 'Q6143337', 'Q6143352', 'Q6201315']","[['James Smith', '0.6362'], ['None', '0.3638']]"

2016-07-04,"The Aussie weakened initially following the release of the Australian election results overnight although weakness proved short-lived. The election results were inconclusive with results showing so far that neither the Liberal-National coalition nor the opposition Labour Party can form a majority government. The Liberal-National coalition leads in 66 seats compared to 72 seats for the Labour Party with both falling short of the 76 seats required to hold a majority in the lower house. According to Bloomberg, postal votes may decide as many as 12 unclear seats. The final results are expected tomorrow. Political instability is not really new for Australia which has had three different Prime Ministers since 2013. The last time Australia had a hung parliament was in 2010 and on that occasion weakness in the Australian dollar proved similarly fleeting. We do not expect the performance of Australian dollar beyond the very near-term to be driven by domestic political developments. The Australian dollar is benefitting from the relief rally in risk assets following the Brexit vote as fears that it would trigger a sharper slowdown in global growth have not materialized. The FT has reported as well that the global economy was in reasonably good shape just before the Brexit vote. According to Fulcrum's nowcast models global growth was running at 3.5% in June which was significantly above growth rates recorded for the majority of 2015 and early in 2016. It should help the global economy to better absorb the negative Brexit vote shock which is expected to be only modest.

This spilt broadly into North American trading, seeing the Dow and other main markets recapture roughly half of Wednesday's losses. The price continued to be paid, of course, through global bond markets, whose sell-off continued on Thursday having wiped out an estimated US$ 1 trillion of value from international government debt since 8th November. Asian markets also rallied, reversing modestly weaker openings into small gains by the close, led by the Nikkei which continues to celebrate more than a 13% fall in the Yen versus the US$ since the presidential election. Traders appeared neither surprised nor concerned by the seemingly uneventful meeting of Leaders of the European Union in which the various institutions and national governments began to argue over their individual responsibilities during forthcoming Brexit negotiations, although the principal findings amply demonstrated just how complex the issues actually are the extended period required to reach agreement. One point of accord was found, however, regarding the new security threat posed by Trump's call for the Continent to shoulder a greater responsibility for its own military and defence duties, resulting in approval for forward planning to increase spend in these areas. Meanwhile, Greece's refusal to back down in its escalating conflict with creditors, as judges on Thursday approved annual bonuses for poorer pensioners and tax relief for the Aegean Islands that have received refugees, sparked angry exchanges with Germany and highlighted again the extent of policy disagreement between member states. Today is expected to see rather lacklustre trading in London, as investors await macro releases including the CBI Industrial Trends Survey and Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin; the Eurozone is due to publish its Harmonised CPI figures, while the EU is due to provide Housing Starts before the Fed's Jeffrey Lacker speaks. Corporates due to provide earnings or trading updates include Bilby (BILB. L), MySQUAR (MYSQ. L), Trinity Mirror (TNI. L) and United Carpets (UCG. L).

2016-07-08,"There are three links (economic, financial and political) and only two of three matter for USD/CAD with the impact reinforcing our call USD/CAD to retest 1.35 in Q3. The 200dma sits near 1.33 so a break of that levels sets up an immediate objective of 1.35 -- also our yearend forecast. The critical link between USD/CAD and Brexit runs through the economic channel but more through the US than the Europe. Indeed, the first chart shows the average five-year share of Canadian exports to individual countries (as a percentage of the total). The US accounts for the bulk of exports at close to 80%. Exports to the UK only account for around 3.9% of the share over the past five years. What's more, the most recent data from 2015 show Canada drifting away from the UK with the export share slipping to 3.6% from 3.9%, suggesting trade links are starting to dwindle. This argues that despite the broader slowdown in Europe direct spillovers to Canada are limited. The focus, therefore, should shift to the impact on the US -- Canada's largest trading partner. TD looks for about a 20bp drag on the US economy over the next year based on the implications from Brexit. This is not a large shock but it comes at the wrong time. Notably, the BoC has focused for some time on the pickup in external demand to help the rotation from energy to non-export exports. This rotation has been rocky, at best, and forward-looking indicators suggest US demand is decelerating. This complicates their narrative and the string of weaker trade reports argues for a possible shift in tone from the BoC next week, adding another headwind to CAD. We still think risk appetite is the most immediate trigger for CAD weakness. Our recent piece argued that CAD is currently the high-beta G10 currency in the G10. This reflects in part market positioning, links to oil, and a negative capital flow position, all of which are exasperated by European political uncertainties. The combination of this week's NFP report and next week's BoC could help mark a turning point in USD/CAD, especially if NFP rebounds from last months dreadful headline and the BoC starts to sing a new tune. With USD/CAD trading near the top end of its recent range, we prefer to follow the momentum rather than fade the move at this stage and like buying dips below 1.30.",Mark McCormick,['Q19561473'],"[['Mark McCormick', '0.692'], ['None', '0.308']]"

Only RBS requires further monitoring but, more importantly, it doesn't need to raise more capital, it needs only to keep shedding risky assets. It is also news that things aren't even worse under such a doomsday scenario that is keeping RBS shares from holding the FTSE wooden spoon. Their 3.7% fall is less than that of CPI whose shares have broken below 8yr support at 550p. While a weak showing is understandable, along with small gains for LLOY and HSBC and small losses for STAN, the overall impact is rather measured, likely thanks to Carney's early intervention. However our standout performer this morning has to be BARC posting minimal losses of 0.2% despite a capital shortfall and being more investment banking and internationally exposed.

Products & Solutions continues to develop positively with organic growth in all major markets, and both the operating profit and the operating margin continue to grow. During the quarter, we saw very good organic growth in Air Movement and Fire & Smoke, the product areas which are related to the major acquisitions completed in 2015. Building Systems showed organic growth and a positive operating profit thanks to a continued focus on market diversification to Western Europe and Africa. The market situation in Russia and CIS remains challenging. The project concerning the establishment of a distribution centre in Grevie is going according to plan. Once established, the centre will increase product availability and productivity in the supply chain. It is an important project, as we have seen a large increase in the number of orders delivered from the factories in Grevie and Förslöv in recent years. During the quarter, sheet metal prices increased rapidly in all our markets, prompting us to announce necessary price increases for the second half of 2016. The UK is our third largest market and represented 9 percent of our external sales in 2015. It is still too early to say what consequences Brexit will have for Lindab.

Given a large overhang of long CAD positioning, we think a reassessment by the BoC could kick-start the move to 1.35. For a start, the BoC will need to mark-to-market is macro forecasts a touch to account for recent slowdown. This reflects the impact of the wildfires, but growth is still slowing. It is clear that Canadian growth has decelerated and is currently running well below potential. This backdrop should see the BoC drop its glass-is-half-full stance, especially with the Brexit impact likely adding downside risks to their outlook. The impact of data surprises matters for more for tier one data, which also offers little comfort for policy makers. Notably, Canada has seen significant downside surprises in trade, employment, and other reports. The latest BoC survey also showed `subdued' sentiment. Finally, despite the recent rally in oil, we note that CAD is trading rich to commodity prices. Indeed, the final chart shows CAD against a Canadian terms of trade basket. Even though oil gets all the hype, Canada also exports gold, paper, natural gas, lumber, and wheat. These other commodities account for about half of the terms of trade basket so should also be taken into consideration when benchmarking CAD.

2016-07-21,"The refugee crisis was already leading to the slow disintegration of the European Union. Then, on June 23, it contributed to an even greater calamity -- Brexit. Both of these crises have reinforced xenophobic, nationalist movements across the continent. They will try to win a series of key votes in the coming year -- including national elections in France, the Netherlands, and Germany in 2017, a referendum in Hungary on EU refugee policy on Oct. 2, a rerun of the Austrian presidential election on the same day, and a constitutional referendum in Italy in October or November of this year. Rather than uniting to resist this threat, EU member states have become increasingly unwilling to cooperate with one another. They pursue self-serving, discordant migration policies, often to the detriment of their neighbors. In these circumstances, a comprehensive and coherent European asylum policy is not possible in the short term, despite the efforts of the EU's governing body, the European Commission. The trust needed for cooperation is lacking. It will have to be rebuilt through a long and laborious process. This is unfortunate, because a comprehensive policy ought to remain the highest priority for European leaders; the union cannot survive without it. The refugee crisis is not a one-off event; it augurs a period of higher migration pressures for the foreseeable future, due to a variety of causes including demographic and economic imbalances between Europe and Africa, unending conflicts in the broader region, and climate change. Beggar-thy-neighbor migration policies, such as building border fences, will not only further fragment the union; they also seriously damage European economies and subvert global human rights standards.",George Soros,['Q12908'],"[['George Soros', '0.7838'], ['None', '0.2162']]"

Our new mandate (client) is a brand name that historically has been synonymous with quality and style in the hospitality industry. The mandate is a very interesting one with the core aspects of the deal being the acquisition and build-out of new hotels in the United Kingdom. Since Brexit at the end of June (2016), we have seen UK property represented at an almost 15% discount to non-sterling (GBP) investors, making the already attractive proposition of this mandate even more appealing due to the recent decline of the British Pound. In the leisure rich Arab Emirates, we anticipate a strong interest from our funding partners to not only take advantage of the current sterling weakness but also to be involved in such an iconic brand. This is a long term commitment by both the client and our Company with a substantial capital raise over time, hence it is a very exciting time for Global Equity.

2016-07-04,"London equities are likely to continue their recent positive run in early trading this morning, with the FTSE-100 seen opening up around 30 points. The Chancellor, George Osborne, appears to be reacting quickly to concerns of capital flight from the UK, prompted by Vodafone's post-Brexit suggestion that it may consider relocating its HQ from London to Europe, by proposing plans to cut the base level of UK corporation tax to just 15%. The new tax target outlined on Sunday in a FT interview cuts the projected rate from 17% by 2020 and would make the UK the lowest amongst the G20 industrialised and developing economies, putting it close the 12.5% level offer by Ireland which has been sufficient to attract a number of major US companies. Meanwhile, the timetable for the UK to formally begin `divorce proceedings' by enacting Article 50 appears to be slipping further as politicians state their determination to first grasp with the complexities involved, thereby choosing to ignore pleas from the EU to end the uncertainty as soon as possible. European Central Bank executive board member Beno & icirc; t Coeuré recognised this yesterday, suggesting the ECB will now take time to gauge how eurozone banks and businesses will react to the shock before unleashing any fresh stimulus measures. Today's Independence Day holiday means the US markets will be closed after making minor gains on Friday despite a lacklustre Employment Report for June, meaning traders should also anticipate a relatively low European daily trading volume. Shares in Asia, however, were higher across the board this morning, as investors took up hints that their central banks, most particularly the Bank of Japan, will shortly introduce new easing measures to encourage economic growth, most likely trimming rates further while expanding asset re-purchase programmes.

2016-07-14,"Three weeks ago, Britain was a committed member of the European Union, David Cameron was Prime Minister and I was minister for skills in his government. Now we are on our way out of the EU, Theresa May is Prime Minister and both David Cameron and I are backbenchers. Politics is never predictable. I thought the UK would be better off staying in the EU and campaigned hard for that result. But once it became clear that the British people had voted to leave and David Cameron announced his resignation, I concluded that Brexit could best be delivered by a Prime Minister who had campaigned for it. So on the day after the referendum I tried to persuade Michael Gove to run for leader. He refused, declaring that he thought Boris Johnson would make the better candidate. I had hated being on the opposite sides of the referendum from Michael - he is my closest friend and political soulmate - so I decided to support him in whatever he decided and joined him on Boris' team. For three days we tried very hard to make it work. Boris has enormous gifts and we really hoped he could combine them with the discipline and focus required to be Prime Minister. But it was not to be. When Michael and I both realised that neither of us would be able to vote for Boris to become leader and Prime Minister, we knew we could not in good conscience urge our parliamentary colleagues to do the same. Finally, reluctantly, Michael agreed that he should stand for leader himself. Of course I wish we had never ended up in the position. Of course I wish I had been able to persuade Michael Gove to stand for leader from the start. But what's done is done. Once Theresa May's victory in the leadership contest was confirmed, I knew that I needed to accept the consequences of my actions and return, voluntarily, to the backbenches. There I will support our new Prime Minister in her noble ambition to make Britain a country that works for everyone, not just a privileged few.

2016-07-13,"The survey was conducted over the period July 4 to July 7. By the time of the survey market volatility associated with `Brexit' had largely settled down and media commentary was, correctly in my view, concentrating on the implications for the UK economy rather than the initial reaction which speculated on some disastrous contagion for the whole of Europe. However concerns would have lingered for many respondents given the blanket publicity which the `Brexit' development received. On the other hand election uncertainty persisted throughout most of the survey period. Respondents would have been particularly unnerved about the prospect of an inconclusive election result given the experience during the last `hung' Parliament in 2010 to 2013. Consequently, to see the Index fall by only 3%, back to its level of March 2016 and still 4.2% above its April level is encouraging. Since the end of the survey period we have seen some welcome political certainty with the prospect of a hung Parliament avoided. It is reasonable to speculate that had the survey been conducted over the last few days the results would have been more positive. Furthermore, we expect the Reserve Bank to move to cut rates again following its meeting on August 2. Following the cut in May the Index surged by 8.5% putting it firmly in positive territory above 100, indicating optimists outnumber pessimists. With the Index currently poised only slightly below 100 we can be reasonably confident that the Index will be back above a 100 next month despite having to negotiate two major shocks in `Brexit' and election uncertainty. With the AUD lifting above USD0.76 and the inflation target at risk it seems a sensible policy option to cut rates further. However we are mindful that despite cutting rates the Board did not lower its growth forecasts indicating that the motivation behind the May decision was entirely around the need to credibly achieve the inflation target over the forecast period. Rigid adherence to that policy in future might be questioned particularly, as hinted at in this survey, if the rate cuts spill over into excessive exuberance in asset markets. Hence we expect that this cut will, most likely, be the last in the current easing cycle.",Bill Evans,"['Q16196443', 'Q16728874', 'Q4908925', 'Q4908926', 'Q4908927', 'Q862106']","[['Bill Evans', '0.6969'], ['None', '0.3031']]"

However there are two things to watch out for. First, any comments on the EU referendum could be market moving. One possibility is that the Governor will allude to his view of adverse economic implications of a Brexit -- that might make the MPC look dovish. But will this instead help sterling rally if such comments are seen to help the `remain' campaign? Second, further falls in sterling and rises in the oil price since the last Inflation Report in February may see the MPC nudge up their inflation forecast. All else equal, that would be seen as a hawkish signal. UK data yesterday was fairly mixed with UK Industrial production growing at 0.3% mom against a consensus of 0.5% and the manufacturing sector expanding by 0.1% mom against a consensus of 0.3%. However we did see an upward revisions to the January and February data. Despite this a slightly softer than expected March growth rate might point to less momentum going into Q2 than previously expected. And, looking at the broader trend, the manufacturing data in particular remain lacklustre. Following the release Sterling fell marginally, with GBPUSD falling just below 1.44 and trading in the low 1.44 s for most of the session.

For example, the new buyer enquiry balance fell to -22.3%, its lowest level since August 2008, while agreed sales declined to a 17-month low of -7.1%.

2016-05-25,"EUR/GBP has now retraced around two thirds of its move higher from earlier this year falling towards the 0.7600-level after peaking at just over the 0.8100-level in April. It clearly highlights that after the pound's recent rebound, the market is now pricing in a more modest Brexit risk premium which is likely to result in a more modest initial bounce higher should the UK vote to remain within the EU on the 23rd June. The latest ORB phone poll released yesterday added to evidence signalling that public support for the UK to remain within the EU is strengthening. The ORB poll revealed that 57% of Conservative voters now say they will vote to remain compared to just 34% in March. Even among the over 65's, 52% of voters are now backing remain compared to 34% in March as well. The performance of the pound beyond the referendum result would then switch back to being driven by economic fundamentals. For the pound to remain on stronger footing following a vote to remain, it will require building evidence that the UK economy has regained a firmer footing after slowing more materially early this year. At the current juncture, we are prepared to give the benefit of doubt that heightened uncertainty ahead of the referendum is the main driver of recent weaker growth which should rebound in the second half of the year as uncertainty eases. However, if weaker growth continues after the referendum we would have to reassess our more favourable outlook for the pound. We believe that there is an even lower to non-existent Brexit risk premium priced into the euro. We do not subscribe to the view that the euro would also bounce if Brexit is avoided although it removes the risk of a sharper decline. The euro would likely come under downward pressure against both the pound and US dollar. If the UK votes to remain it would give the green light for the Fed to resume rate hikes in July assuming that they haven't already raised rates before the referendum in June.",Lee Hardman,['Q16866367'],"[['Lee Hardman', '0.7159'], ['None', '0.2841']]"

2016-07-02,"In Theresa May, Stephen Crabb, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom and Liam Fox, we have five strong candidates, with vastly different skills and experiences-all of whom could competently take on the role of Conservative Party leader. But we are not just looking for a party leader, but a Prime Minister in very uncertain times. Theresa May has the most suitable experience, temperament and skills to take on the awesome responsibility of becoming Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She also has a clear and positive vision for the future of our country. I have consulted widely in my constituency and discussed the candidates with many members of my local Conservative Association over the last few days. From the conversations I have had, Theresa May is the preferred candidate of both the local electorate and local Conservative members and supporters -- including many who had supported Brexit. As Home Secretary for more than 6 years, Theresa May has shown she has tenacity and staying power. She is not afraid of taking on difficult tasks or of fighting vested interests. She exudes competence. She takes her job seriously. By her own admission, she does not hang around the tea rooms and bars of the House of Commons gossiping or trying to curry favour. She gets on with the job in hand and is laser focused on that job until it is done. When Theresa May visited my constituency in 2014 she held a Q&A session and showed that she was not only a master of her own Home Office brief, but of every other department too. Everyone who attended the event said how impressive she was. For a long time Theresa May has advanced an agenda of modernisation and reform within the Conservative Party and the country. As she said yesterday: `We have shown that when the Conservatives have an open, inclusive, One Nation agenda of social reform, we win elections -- and we change the country for the better.' Theresa May is best positioned to bring the country and the party together after a bruising referendum debate. As leader I know that Theresa May will continue the social reform programme started by David Cameron and will work towards making the UK an even wealthier and fairer society.

However, although our survey does agree with this general perspective, it also clearly shows that the majority of business leaders surveyed are feeling positive about the Brexit landscape and the future opportunities that not belonging to the EU may bring, including reduced regulation and a new sense of freedom. We believe this positive outlook is a new development over the last couple of months.

In contrast, Theresa Maybacked the campaign to remain in the EU and, although she has eurosceptic tendencies, it is widely thought that Theresa May is more likely to seek a `soft Brexit' (sometimes called the `Norwegian plus' option) from the EU, which maintains access to the European single market, including financial services, and some (crucially largely symbolic) restriction on free movement. Second, it avoids a two-month long leadership campaign and lifts one source of uncertainty in the UK.

2016-07-18,"Moreover, concerns over the health of the labour market have diminished after the June employment report. This turnaround is also reflected in the ISM business surveys. The manufacturing ISM rose for the second consecutive month in June (taking it to its highest level since early 2015), and the non-manufacturing survey also bounced back from its May lull, reaching its highest level since November last year. At the same time, consumer confidence remains solid. The main risks from the `Brexit' vote comes from financial market disturbances -- which are relatively muted at this stage -- and from any contagion to the rest of Europe, with which the US has much larger ties. We expect that the economy will continue to grow at a moderate pace. The recent experience has been one of growth driven by consumption and residential investment, while investment and trade have been weak. This should broadly continue although it is likely that there will be some convergence. The economy should also continue to benefit from a mild fiscal policy tailwind. Despite the unemployment rate being close to the Fed's estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate, and inflation moving in the right direction towards the Fed's 2% target, we expect the Fed will remain on hold until December. It was not so long ago that the Fed was strongly signalling a June or July rate hike. However, the very weak May employment report and then the uncertainty caused by the UK referendum has put paid to that. Fed officials have indicated that they are monitoring any fall out from Brexit, and it will take several months of data before they can assess this. Moreover, they appear very risk averse both to market developments but also to fluctuations in activity indicators (which are volatile in the best of times).

2016-07-08,"Britain faces a frightening array of economic risks if Parliament makes a mess of Brexit, but a sterling crisis is not one of them. A weaker exchange rate acts as a shock absorber. It cushions the downturn to some degree and strengthens our buffers against deflation. Those fretting about the inflationary risk of a lower pound are stuck in a time warp, or living on the wrong planet. Global bond yields are touching historic lows every day and signaling a deflationary depression into the next decade. This is not like the 1930s. It is worse. Investors are so frightened-or so short of safe debt to buy - that Switzerland can borrow for 50 years at rates below zero, Germany and Japan for 15 years, and France and Holland for nine years. Roughly $10.7 trillion of sovereign debt and $1 trillion of corporate debt is now trading at negative rates worldwide. British 10-year yields have collapsed to an all-time low of 0.73 pc since the Brexit vote, and 30-year yields are down to 1.58 pc. This would not be happening if the bond vigilantes had the slightest concern that Britain was heading into a stagflation trap. After all, the essence of ZIRP and NIRP is to drive interest rates below their natural market clearing levels so as to induce more borrowing and spending by business and consumers. It's also the inherent result of massive QE bond-buying where central banks finance their purchases with credits conjured from thin air.

Credit also offers some interesting risk / return, in the investment grade space, which is supported by the European Central Bank in Europe, but also in the high yield and the peripheral govies space. In terms of geography: (i) emerging markets have hit a bottom and represent a good opportunity (equities and debt); (ii) U.S. Treasuries continue to be the most efficient tail hedge against volatility; (iii) there is still value -- even though it may sound like an unconventional view today -- in European equities; and (iv) a cautious stance should be adopted on GBP assets as we wait for more obvious opportunities. Certainly the road will be bumpy and Brexit is only one -- important -- piece of the equation; e.g., the global situation in China and growth dynamic in the US must be monitored carefully. We nevertheless consider that the period which begins now will offer significant opportunities for investors to rethink their asset allocation and reinforce their exposures to some risky asset at a better price.

2016-08-30,"Globalization has enabled countries to reach a certain level of economic development comparatively easily today, but once they reach that level they tend to be quickly overtaken by other emerging economies and fall into the category of pursued economies. Additionally, a look at the changes in economic development over this extremely long time span makes it clear that there are many instances of accepted beliefs that were valid in one era no longer working in the next. Many of those supporting the candidacy of Donald Trump in the US presidential election are blue-collar voters with relatively low incomes who look back with fondness on the nation's golden era. Similarly, older voters who can recall the glory of the British Empire easily outnumbered younger voters among those who voted for Brexit in the UK. The external environments faced by both Britain and the US have changed remarkably, and a return to the days when a high school graduate could buy a spacious home and a large automobile on a single income is simply not possible. The arguments of Mr. Trump and the Brexit camp are well received by so many because they elicit nostalgia for the golden eras of the past. This is something that must be closely watched, because they are pushing the country to a goal that does not exist. Japan, too, needs to accept that there is no going back to the golden era, and that the accepted beliefs that worked then will no longer work today. It must engage in extensive reforms of its economy, society, and educational system to ensure that they remain relevant for today's world. A pursued economy that implements these reforms and is able to achieve a proper mix of fiscal and monetary policy will be able to remain an advanced economy.

The fact that UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, was seemingly forced yesterday to accept Labour's demands that she sets out her ultra-sensitive Brexit plans to Parliament, while the resignation of Italian leader, Matteo Renzi, a couple of days ago appears to signal the wave of populism has now landed in the heart of the EU with New Year elections in France and Germany potentially threatening the very foundation of the Euro, quite staggeringly appears to be passing by unnoticed.

2016-07-22,"Recent US data has shown that recession fears were overdone while the Brexit shock is still likely to see policy makers inject further stimulus to smooth the transition. In Japan, voters granted the Abe administration fresh support to push on with Abenomics 2.0. News reports indicate a JPY20 trillion stimulus package is in the works. The combination of these factors has helped risk sentiment recover, boosting the search for yield and carry. Since May, the carry basket has outperformed both the broad USD and the momentum basket. This is also consistent with price action in the majors with AUD and NZD leading gains in the G10 since mid-Q2. With the Fed likely to maintain its neutral tone next week, the BoE, RBNZ and RBA possibly seen easing next month and Japan expected to introduce another round of macro economic stimulus to boot, we think carry could have a few more weeks left to run. That said, with global growth unlikely to accelerate above trend and market uncertainties likely to persist into H2, we believe G10 carry basket are unlikely maintain their strength for long. This backdrop has probably led to a few crowded trades in the G10 that are likely to get squeezed on a shift in the macro environment. We think US data and Fed pricing is the first trigger that could shakeup market pricing. There is large outstanding longs in CAD, JPY and CHF but also a build-up in AUD and NZD over the past month. The market also remains underweight USD relative to the past three years, increasing scope for squeeze on better US data. Besides the Fed, we think policy and data events from Japan and the UK could also trigger a shift in sentiment. For one, those looking for helicopter money in Japan may be disappointed while a turn in UK data could lead to a rise in risk aversion as economic impact of Brexit unfolds. Most European currencies are cheap but also that AUD and NZD are expensive.

2016-09-20,"We are pleased to report quarterly revenues well above those for the same period last year and consistent with our recent second quarter, excluding the impact of the markup last quarter in two listed equity positions, which had no meaningful impact on our third quarter results. Aside from a volatile two week period following the unexpected outcome of the UK `Brexit' referendum in June, fixed income and equity secondary market conditions remained reasonably steady for much of the third quarter. However, new issue activity continued to be slow industry-wide for most of the period. Our equity net revenues were $148 million, compared to $224 million for the second quarter and $203 million for the third quarter of last year. Two listed equity block positions, including KCG, that were marked up by $60 million in the second quarter, generated only about $2 million of further net total mark ups during the third quarter. The same two positions, as well as two additional securities positions that had an immaterial impact on the third quarter results, were marked up by a net total of $66 million in the third quarter of last year. Fixed Income net revenues were $195 million, compared to $238 million for the second quarter and up significantly from the poor year-ago quarter of negative $18 million. Our sales and trading credit businesses, including mortgages, corporates, leveraged credit and our recently enhanced emerging markets business, continued to perform well. Investment banking net revenues were $295 million and reflect solid advisory revenues, but a slower new issuance environment. Our backlog for the fourth quarter represents the highest level of backlog we have experienced this year. We have continued to expand into new sub-sectors and geographies, as well as enhance existing coverage. Our average daily VaR for the third quarter was $6.62 million, versus $8.25 million for the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease reflects both a reduction in risk, as well as lower asset price volatility. Average daily VaR for the third quarter was the lowest we have recorded since the fourth quarter of 2010.",Rich Handler,['Q7323856'],"[['Rich Handler', '0.735'], ['None', '0.1659'], ['Brian Friedman', '0.0991']]"

The downturn, whether manifesting itself in order book cancellations, a lack of new orders or the postponement or halting of projects, was most commonly attributed in one way or another to `Brexit' . The one ray of light was an improvement in manufacturing export growth to the best for two years as the weak pound helped drive overseas sales, though producers also suffered the flip-side of a weak currency as import prices spiked higher. At this level, the survey is signalling a 0.4% contraction of the economy in the third quarter, though much of course depends on whether we see a further deterioration in August or if July represents a shock-induced nadir. Given the record slump in service sector business expectations, the suggestion is that there is further pain to come in the short-term at least.

Still, the US interest market is more fearful that it will have a more significant negative impact on the US economy and thereby dovish impact on Fed policy which is now not expected to resume raising rates until after next year. The more dovish outlook for Fed policy is helping to dampen upside for the US dollar in the near-term. The release today of the latest FOMC minutes from their mid-June meeting are expected to reiterate that the Fed is in no hurry to resume rates hikes in the near-term, and imply that the Fed will require even more time to re-assess the outlook for the US economy and policy following the Brexit vote. Prior to the Brexit vote, the Fed's updated projections signalled that it was planning to raise rates at least one more time this year which appears less likely now but not completely ruled out. The release of the ISM non-manufacturing survey for June will also be watched closely today to assess if the US economy is regaining a firmer footing after the weak start to the year.

Configuration of risks (In India) the prolonged sluggishness in the capital goods sector is indicative of weak investment demand... Business confidence is also looking up in recent months, though the Reserve Bank's survey for March 2016 suggests that capacity utilisation, seasonally adjusted, is still weak. l Retail inflation measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose to a 22-month high in June, with a sharp pick-up in momentum overwhelming favourable base effects. In the external sector, merchandise export growth moved into positive territory in June after 18 months... On the other hand, imports continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace than in recent months. On balance, inflation projections as given in the June bi-monthly statement, that is, of a central trajectory towards 5% by March 2017 with risks tilted to the upside, are retained (the chart gives a range of 4.8 to 6.4%).

2016-05-30,"Last Monday, HM Treasury published a new report on the short-term economic consequences of a Brexit.

The `leave' camp dismissed the findings and accused David Cameron and George Osborne of running a campaign of fear. Based on new ONS figures showing 77,000 EU citizens came to the UK without a job in 2015, former Mayor of London Boris Johnson repeated that the UK cannot control its own borders and limit immigration. He said a `leave' win is the `only way to take back control of immigration' . Last week showed further signs that Brexit concerns have eased in the financial markets. This week, the GBP once again outperformed all other G10 currencies, implied FX volatility on GBP crosses fell slightly while expectations of a Bank of England rate cut in 2016 eased further in the UK money market. The market now prices in the first full 25bp rate hike in the UK in June 2018 (moved forward from December 2018).

2016-08-02,"With the BoJ running out of policy options at the current juncture, the burden for supporting the growth and inflation outlook in Japan is falling more heavily onto fiscal policy. The BoJ took into consideration the impact of looser fiscal policy as well at last week's policy meeting and it is one reason why they did not ease monetary policy more aggressively. Further details of the government's fiscal stimulus plan have been reported overnight by Bloomberg ahead of the official announcement today. According to a draft version of the budget, the plan includes JPY13.5 trillion of fiscal measures. The report states that new spending will total JPY7.5 trillion of which JPY4.6 trillion (about 1% of GDP) is planned for the current fiscal year. The fiscal measures include: i) JPY3.4 trillion for steps to improve demographics, JPY6.2 trillion for infrastructure, JPY1.3 to mitigate Brexit risks and help smaller companies & regions, and iv) JPY2.7 trillion for relief measures for April's Kunamoto quakes and 2011 Tohoku disaster. The fiscal plan is expected to modestly lift the outlook for growth in Japan in the year ahead. However, we do not expect it to materially increase inflation expectations and as such it is unlikely to re-weaken the yen. We continue to expect the yen to remain on a stronger footing.
